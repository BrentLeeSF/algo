Design Pattens - a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design
-a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations


1. Behavioral pattern 
-explains how objects interact. 
-It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and 
-how the steps of a task are divided among different objects. 
Where Creational patterns mostly describe a moment of time (the instant of creation), and Structural patterns describe a more or less static structure, Behavioral patterns describe a process or a flow

BEHAVIORAL
Chain of responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change

2. Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms and are used in situations when basic form of object creation could result in design problems or increase complexity of a code base.

CREATIONAL
Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist


3.Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by
- identifying a simple way to realise relationships between entities or defines a manner -for creating relationships between objects.

Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
Bridge - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
Proxy - An object representing another object
